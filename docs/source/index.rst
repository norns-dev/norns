Welcome to norns's documentation!
==========================================

Norns is a self-hosted solution for groups to organize parties for TTRPGs.

Version 0.1.0 is a proof of concept but much more useful features are planned
for the future, including:

- Scheduling sessions
- Automated reminders of sessions
- DM blogging
- Quest tracking
- Player journals
- Party chat
- And more...

As a proof of concept, the exact configuration is specific to my implementation and as such there are no deployment
instructions. Expect these to be completed in a future release.
